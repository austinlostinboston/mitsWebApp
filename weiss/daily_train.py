This file builds a model from training data, which can be incorporated into daily pipeline.
===========================================================================================

TODO(wenjunw@cs.cmu.edu):
- change the path of training file, its transformed feature file, and the model file
  currently these files are in the same directory as this python script.
- In the feature, the parameter values of the SVM classifier may be modified

Usage: python daily_train.py
